# Security Best Practices for CCTV/DVR Systems

This document provides security recommendations based on common vulnerabilities found in IP cameras and DVR systems.

## Common Vulnerabilities

### 1. Default Credentials
**Risk Level: Critical**

Many CCTV cameras and DVRs ship with default credentials that are:
- Publicly documented
- Same across all devices of a manufacturer
- Easy to guess (admin/admin, admin/12345, etc.)

**Mitigation:**
- Change all default passwords immediately after installation
- Use strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters)
- Implement password complexity requirements
- Use a password manager for storing credentials

### 2. Exposed Web Interfaces
**Risk Level: High**

Web-based management interfaces exposed to the internet allow:
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Exploitation of web application vulnerabilities
- Information disclosure

**Mitigation:**
- Restrict web interface access to trusted networks only
- Use VPN for remote management
- Implement IP whitelisting
- Disable UPnP to prevent automatic port forwarding

### 3. Unencrypted Streams (RTSP)
**Risk Level: High**

Unencrypted RTSP streams can be:
- Intercepted and viewed by attackers
- Accessed without authentication
- Used for reconnaissance

**Mitigation:**
- Enable authentication on all RTSP streams
- Use RTSPS (RTSP over TLS) when available
- Segment camera network from other networks
- Monitor for unauthorized stream access

### 4. Outdated Firmware
**Risk Level: Critical**

Outdated firmware may contain:
- Known security vulnerabilities
- Unpatched exploits
- Backdoors discovered by researchers

**Mitigation:**
- Regularly check for firmware updates
- Subscribe to manufacturer security bulletins
- Test updates in non-production environment first
- Maintain firmware version inventory

### 5. Network Exposure
**Risk Level: High**

Direct internet exposure increases attack surface:
- Port scanning by malicious actors
- Automated exploitation attempts
- DDoS attack participation (botnets)

**Mitigation:**
- Place cameras on isolated VLAN
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Implement network segmentation
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

## Security Hardening Checklist

### Initial Setup
- [ ] Change all default credentials
- [ ] Update firmware to latest version
- [ ] Disable unnecessary services and ports
- [ ] Enable HTTPS for web interface
- [ ] Configure strong encryption for streams

### Network Configuration
- [ ] Create dedicated VLAN for cameras
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Disable UPnP
- [ ] Implement network access controls
- [ ] Set up network monitoring

### Access Control
- [ ] Implement principle of least privilege
- [ ] Create separate admin and viewer accounts
- [ ] Enable two-factor authentication if available
- [ ] Regular audit of user accounts
- [ ] Implement session timeouts

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Enable security event logging
- [ ] Configure log forwarding to SIEM
- [ ] Regular security assessments
- [ ] Periodic password changes
- [ ] Review and update access controls

## Manufacturer-Specific Issues

### Hikvision
- CVE-2017-7921: Unauthorized access vulnerability
- CVE-2021-36260: Command injection
- **Recommendation:** Update to latest firmware, disable unnecessary features

### Dahua
- CVE-2021-33044: Authentication bypass
- Default Telnet access enabled
- **Recommendation:** Disable Telnet, update firmware, change default ports

### Axis
- Generally more secure than competitors
- Still requires password changes and updates
- **Recommendation:** Follow manufacturer security guidelines

### Generic/OEM Devices
- Often rebranded products with same vulnerabilities
- May have limited update support
- **Recommendation:** Additional network-level protection

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- Implement appropriate security measures
- Document data processing activities
- Ensure proper access controls
- Regular security assessments

### PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry)
- Cameras in retail environments
- Network segmentation required
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Strong access controls

### HIPAA (Healthcare)
- Cameras in medical facilities
- Encryption requirements
- Access logging and monitoring
- Regular risk assessments

## Incident Response

### If Compromised:
1. **Immediately isolate** affected devices from network
2. **Document** current state before making changes
3. **Analyze** logs for indicators of compromise
4. **Reset** devices to factory defaults
5. **Update** firmware to latest version
6. **Reconfigure** with new, strong credentials
7. **Monitor** for continued suspicious activity
8. **Report** incident to appropriate authorities

## Regular Review

Security is an ongoing process. Schedule regular reviews:
- **Monthly:** Check for firmware updates
- **Quarterly:** Credential rotation
- **Annually:** Full security assessment
- **As needed:** After security incidents or major changes

**Remember:** Security is a continuous process, not a one-time setup. Regular monitoring, updates, and assessments are essential for maintaining a secure surveillance system.
